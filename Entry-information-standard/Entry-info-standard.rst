Entry information standard
===================================
BIII.eu software entry information standard
----------------------------------
The standard described here (still under discussion) provides guidelines to support `BIII.eu webtool <http://www.biii.eu/>`_ curators to monitor the webtool content and tagging. This standard was adapted from the `Tool information standard <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchemaDocs/blob/master/information_standard.rst#biotools-information-standard>`_ documentation from `ELIXIR bio.tools <https://github.com/bio-tools/>`_. Thanks to `Jon Ison <https://github.com/joncison>`_ for referencing this documentation. 

This standard comprises a list of entry attributes to be specified for an entry to be classified in a 5 tier rating of entry completeness and quality in BIII.eu. 

In addition we provide curation guidelines (still under discussion) describing how each attribute should be specified to ensure the quality of BIII.eu entries. These guidelines are not limited to the syntatic and semantic constraints defined by EDAM-bioimaging ontology and BISE-core-ontology

The standard provides a basis for monitoring of content and labelling of BIII.eu entries initially by: 

* *entry completeness* (5 tiers being "SPARSE", "BASIC DETAILS", "DETAILED", "HIGHLY DETAILED" and "COMPREHENSIVE")

The standard is applied to BIII.eu as follows: 

* "SPARSE": Minimum information requirement for new entries. A SPARSE entry may be invisible in the webtool (and made it clear to the curator adding the entry in the UI) by default and will only show after aditional information is added (similar to what occurs in bio.tools). 
* "BASIC DETAILS":
* "DETAILED":
* "HIGHLY DETAILED":
* "COMPREHENSIVE": Such entries would provide relevant information to users of all backgrounds and are useful resources. The entry attributes will link to information such as a repository, reference publication, training material and will potentially have several related Biological terms, EDAM-Bioimaging Operations and Topics.
